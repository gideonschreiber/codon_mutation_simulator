Simulating the acquisition of mutations throughout evolution. A 50-letter string composed of 10 different characters is subjected to random mutagenesis, with the top scoring sequences (0.5-50%) progressing to the next round of mutagenesis and selection. Specific positions (6, 11, 21, 31, and 41) are designated as reward (R) positions, yielding a positive score when mutated to A, F, C, D, and E, respectively. Each position permits two neutral (N) letters, including the initiating letter, while the remaining 8 (or 7 at reward positions) were assigned a negative score, penalty (P). (B) Quantification of reward, neutral, and penalty mutations, as well as final scores (S), after applying different selection stringencies (top 0.5%, 1%, 5%, 25%, and 50% of scoring sequences). The number of mutations per step, number of parallel sequences and mutations per step are additional variables. All variables above can be changes in the program. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f66fc41c-2b16-4f4f-8f57-d3ec21378e04)
